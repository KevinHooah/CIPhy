# CIPhy
Official implementation for **CIPhy:Causal Intervention with Physical Confounder from IoT Sensor Data for Robust Occupant Information Inference** in the proceedings of SenSys 2022.

- Due to SenSys 2022 Organization issue, the paper has not been released in ACM Digital Library yet, please find the paper [here](https://www.pans-lab.com/_files/ugd/b38a97_c7fb434120554b68b8245e32c4bb7457.pdf) in our lab's webpage.
- The backdoor adjustment and baseline model are following the protocol proposed in this [AAAI 2016 paper](https://github.com/tapilab/aaai-2016-robust).
- The CORAL model's code is adopted from [Dr. Jingdong Wang's Repo](https://github.com/jindongwang/transferlearning/tree/master/code/traditional/CORAL).
- The data used in this experiment can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4691144#.Y3Khh-zMJqs).
